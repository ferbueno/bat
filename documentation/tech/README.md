# BAT Tech Stack

## Front End

### React JS

React JS is a web component library, designed and developed by Facebook, it follows the latest trends in both design and programming. It's the right now and future of web development.

For more information about React JS, please, visit their [website](https://reactjs.org/)

#### Why React JS?

As a proposed PWA (Progressive Web Application), the system should be equipped with the best tech to work both in mobile and desktop devices, which is possible through React JS. React JS allows us, as developers, to code only once, and export it to every environment required.

Updates are easy. When updating the application, there's no need to do a whole lot of things. Just re-deploy the application again into the server, and it will instantaneously be available for everyone.

It's the most used front-end library. Everyone is using React JS, for personal or professional reasons, which allows developer to share libraries between each other to make development easier.

It's built over the most popular language in the *world*. *JavaScript* has become the most popular programming language in the world, and it's still growing.

Web components are the way to go. It's the future of web programming. It allows functionality to be shared across environments without ever recoding.

It's built and maintained by Facebook. Should I say anything more?

## Back End

### Node JS

Node JS, the engine for the most used and most popular language in the world, *JavaScript*.

Node allows us developers to program server oriented *JavaScript*, which has been proven to be equally powerful to many other back end languages. Even Microsoft has opted to build Node applications.

For more information about Node JS, please, visit their [website](https://nodejs.org/en/)

#### Why Node JS?

It has the world's largest software registry. As *JavaScript* is the most popular language, developers have created tons of libraries to be used for specific or general purposes, which makes stable development easier to reach.

Again, the world's most popular language.

The JavaScript environment is light. *JavaScript* does not need a powerful computer to run smoothly, which makes it even better.

###Â GraphQL

GraphQL is a query-directed, REST API substitute designed by Facebook, which gives a powerful solution to multi-endpoint API's and a whole lot of advantages.

For more information about GraphQL, please, visit their [website](https://graphql.org/learn/)

#### Why GraphQL?

It provides with a get-what-you-ask framework. Most API systems, are fixed to what the endpoint is designed to return. Not GraphQL though, every query is built depending on what the user needs at that specific moment, so you will get only what you ask for.

Everything becomes accesible through one endpoint. When creating a REST system, you need to define at least 4 operations per endpoint, to be accesible through every kind of request. *GraphQL* offers tu query only through one endpoint, and calling different functions.

Can be used and built over different languages. *GraphQL* supports different environments with different languages.

The most modern tool to make queries. We like to keep trending with tech, and *GraphQL* is one (if not the) newest ways to build queries into your system.

## Databases

### MongoDB

*MongoDB* is a largely, easily scalable, No-SQL database. Designed to safekeep objects as documents, it gives the flexibility necessary to scale and for a constantly changing system.

For more information about MongoDB, please, visit their [website](https://www.mongodb.com/)

#### Why MongoDB?

High scalability. As a flexible database, it's easier to scale.

Ease of queries. When creating a complex system, SQL queries tend to only grow. Queries to MongoDB keep it simple, and it doesn't matter if the scheme changes, the query is sure to work. (Unless the scheme affects the query, of course).

Compatibility with *JavaScript*.

Open Source. Maintained by an enormous community and still growing.

### Elastic Search *

*Elastic Search* is a highly scalable, full text search & analytics engine, designed to build and answer queries in near real time.

*ElasticSearch* is not yet confirmed to be a part of the stack.

#### Why ElasticSearch?

Unmatched speed. *ElasticSearch* offers unmatched speed when making queries, even with a large amount of documents stored.

REST oriented. The way you build queries to *ElasticSearch*, is through `JSON` and REST calls, such as `GET` and `POST`.

Full text search. Whether you're searching for a part of a word inside a phrase, or a complete sentence, *ElasticSearch* is prepared for both.

## Deployment

### Docker

Docker is an open source, containerization and deployment tool, built to deploy software across multiple environments without breaking a sweat, and with the promise that the execution won't change, regardless of the environment in which it will be deployed.

#### Why Docker?

Most popular deployment tool right now. With container strategy becoming more and more popular, Docker has grown to be the most used deployment tool.

Scalability. Docker offers its users to be able to scale software depending by demand by only executing one command.

Persistence. Docker automatically re-launches a container after it has been shutdown for any reason. That way, we can asure that the service will always be up and running.

Compatibility. Docker is compatible with all the stack mentioned in this document.
