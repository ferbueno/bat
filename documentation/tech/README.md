## Front End

### React JS

React JS is a web component library, designed and developed by Facebook. It follows the latest trends and styles of web programming.

Advantages:
1. Stability
2. Support
3. Community
4. Ease of use

#### Why React JS?

As a proposed PWA (Progressive Web Application), the system should be equipped with the best tech to work both in mobile and desktop devices, which is possible through React JS. React JS allows us, as developers, to code only once, and export it to every environment required.

Updates are easy. When updating the application, there's no need to do a whole lot of things. Just re-deploy the application again into the server, and it will instantaneously be available for everyone.

It's the most used front-end library. Everyone is using React JS, for personal or professional reasons, which allows developer to share libraries between each other to make development easier.

It's built over the most popular language in the *world*. JavaScript has become the most popular programming language in the world, and it's still growing.

Web components are the way to go. It's the future of web programming. It allows functionality to be shared across environments without ever recoding.

It's built and maintained by Facebook. Should I say anything more?

## Back End

### Node JS

Node JS, the engine for the most used and most popular language in the world, JavaScript.

Node allows us developers to program server oriented JavaScript, which has been proven to be equally powerful to many other back end languages. Even Microsoft has opted to build Node applications.

#### Why Node JS?

It has the world's largest software registry. As JavaScript is the most popular language, developers have created tons of libraries to be used for specific or general purposes, which makes stable development easier to reach.

Again, the world's most popular language.

The JavaScript environment is light. JavaScript does not need a powerful computer to run smoothly, which makes it even better.
