# Bat Workflow

## Project Management

#### Scrum

Scrum is a framework within which people can address complex adaptive problems, while productively and creatively delivering products of the highest possible value.

##### Why Scrum?

Scrum is simple and the most popular software development framework today. Because software requirements are changing countinously we can adapt to those changes if we follow this framework.

### Phases

#### 1. Initiate
This phase includes the processes related to initiation of a project: Create Project Vision, Identify Scrum Master and Stakeholder(s), Form Scrum Team, Develop Epic(s), Create Prioritized Product Backlog, and Conduct Release Planning.

#### 2. Plan and estimate
This phase consists of processes related to planning and estimating tasks, which include Create User Stories, Approve, Estimate, and Commit User Stories, Create Tasks, Estimate Tasks, and Create Sprint Backlog.

#### 3. Implement
This phase is related to the execution of the tasks and activities to create a project's product. These activities include creating the various deliverables, conducting Daily Standup Meetings, and grooming (i.e., reviewing, fine-tuning, and regularly updating) the Product Backlog at regular intervals.

#### 4. Review and retrospect
This phase is concerned with reviewing the deliverables and the work that has been done and determining ways to improve the practices and methods used to do project work.

#### 5. Release
This phase emphasizes on delivering the Accepted Deliverables to the customer and identifying, documenting, and internalizing the lessons learned during the project.

## Continuous Delivery 

Continuous Delivery is the ability to get changes of all types—including new features, configuration changes, bug fixes and experiments—into production, or into the hands of users, safely and quickly in a sustainable way.

### Why continuous delivery?

* Low risk releases
* Faster time to market
* Higher quality
* Lower costs
* Better products
* Happier team

### How did we achieve continuous delivery?
We achieve our continous delivery with different components:

* Unit tests: a level of software testing where individual units/ components of a software are tested.
* End to end tests (e2e tests): tests to identify system dependencies and to ensure that the right information is passed between various system components and systems.
* Automated builds: process of automating the creation of a software build and the associated processes including: compiling computer source code into a productions build, and running automated tests (Unit tests and e2e tests).
